A baud, symbol rate or modulation rate is the number of symbol changes or signaling events across the transmission medium. 
A symbol represents one or several bits that encode data.
A baud (Bd) therefore is measured in symbols per seconds. 

A baud rate is not to be confused with gross bit rate, which just tells how many bits over a time period a line can transmit. Only if the symbols are actually one bit, then they are equal. 
For this reason, the baud rate will often be lower than the gross bit rate.

To calculate the baud rate, we need two pieces of information: the bit rate and the number of bits per unit data. The baud rate is then calculated using the following formula:

```
Baud Rate = Bit rate (bps) / Number of bits per unit data
```
