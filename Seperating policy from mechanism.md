The policy is something that needs to be handled by the user or client of a distributed system. The mechanism refers to the inner workings. 
For example:
Caching in a web browser is purely a policy controlled by the client.
Or traffic lights, the mechanism that switches the lights from red, yellow and green is internal implementation, and the policy is how long those lights should stay on.
