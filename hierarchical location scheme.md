In hierarchical location schemes, a network is divided into a collection of domains. There is a single top-level domain that spans the entire network. Each domain can be divided into smaller sub-domains. 
The smallest level domain is called leaf-domain and it typically is a local area network.
Each domain has a node directory that contains the entries of all entities within that domain. This leads to a tree of directory nodes.
