Using [[Prime Numbers|euclids theorem]] we proofed that there are infinitely many prime numbers in form 4n + 3, or written as:
$$
p \equiv 3 \space (mod\space4)
$$
where p are primes. 

If a and b have no factors in common (Teilerfremd) aka only 1 as the greates common divisor, then there are infinitely many primes in form:
$$
p = an + b
$$
where n is a positive integer. In [[Congruence]] words, there are infinitely many primes p in form:
$$
p \equiv a \space (mod\space b)
$$
Dirichlets theorem is therefore extreme generalization of what we proofed with [[Prime Numbers|euclid's theorem]]. This result was and still is extremely difficult to proove.
