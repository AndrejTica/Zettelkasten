The particle "no" is known as the modifying particle. You can see it as the "possession" modifier. Similar to what "of" does in english:

Risa's pen -> Risa no pen.
This is my computer -> Kore wa watashi no konpyuta desu. 
This is mine -> Kore wa watashi no desu.
He is a teacher of english -> Kare wa Eigo no sensei desu.
Sakura no hana -> flower of cherry
My friends name is yuko -> Watashi no tomodachi no namae wa yuko desu.
I like japanese cars -> Nihon no kuruma wa suki desu
