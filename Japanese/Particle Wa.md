Wa is better translated as "As for". Saying Watashi wa means therefore "As for me"
The particle "wa" tells us that the word before is the topic of the sentence. The topic is basically the thing that is being talked about and it usually appears near the beginning of the sentence. The topic of a sentence in japanese is very similar what other languages refer to as the subject, but they are two slightly different things. Wa puts the emphasis on what is before it. The particle wa implies contrast, it emphasizes something, it doesnt change the actuall meaning of the sentence. 

"As for me, im a person"
watashi wa hito desu.
わたし は ひと です。

"As for this, its a car"
kore wa kuruma desu.
これ は くるま です。

"As for the car, its red"
kuruma wa akai desu.
くるま は あか いです。

There is no equivalent translation for the wa in english, as in english to determine what the topic/subject is, we use word ordering. 

For example: "Taro saw Noriko", if we change that to "Noriko saw Taro" we get a completely different meaning. In japanese: "Tarō **wa** Noriko **[[Particle Wo (o)|wo]]** mimashita." 
Wa - defines the "topic" which is basically the person that performs action being described. 
[[Wo]] pronounced "o" defines the object aka to whom or to what the action was done, so Noriko was the thing being seen. 

So we can change the [[Sentence structure|order]] to "Noriko wo Taro wa mimashita" and it would mean effectively the same thing. That being said, we would not use this sentence as its unnatural to place the topic after other elements. Certain orders are more natural than others.

When speaking about the topic/subject they are two different things but we can treat it the same to keep thing simple. For subjects in japanese there is actually the "[[ga]]" particle.
