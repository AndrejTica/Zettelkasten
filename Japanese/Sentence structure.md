Japanese sentence structure is kinda as if maste yoda would speak it. 
First comes the Subject in form of [[Nouns and pronouns|nouns/pronouns]], then the object (the thing that receives the action of the verb) and the the verb (tun-wort). This is in contrast to English where its Subject, verb and then the object: I eat apples
In japanese: I apples eat.  (Watashi wa ringo wo tabemasu)
So basically the object and the verb are switched, the subject stays at the fist place.

That means if we have a simpler sentence structure like "I eat", consisting only of subject and verb, then the structure is the same. (Watashi wa tabemasu).

If we have a subject-verb-noun in english: "He is a teacher", the verb in this case is again at the end: "Kare wa  kyoushi desu". "He teacher is". 

If we have a Subject-verb-[[Adverb|adverb]] in english" "She sings elegantly", the verb is again at the end: "Kanojo wa yuuga ni utaimasu".

If we have a Subject-verb-adjective in english: "The cat is cute", the verb is again at teh end: "Sono neko wa kawaii desu".

Just like in english we can be flexible with the structuring: "It is a cute cat", we can also be flexible with japanese: "Kawaii neko desu". 

It is not uncommon for the object for example to appear before the subject. 

The fundamental difference is that in english, the word order determines who did what. For example I eat apples vs Apples eat I. The order changes who did what.
In japanese its not the order, but the special "markers" called Particles that mark who did what. As long as the right particles are used, the word order can be changed as long as the verb is last.

Japanese sentences can feel incomplete for an english speaker, as there is no "a", "an", "the". That means that both "This is a car" and "This is the car" would both be "Kore wa kuruma desu". Which is meant is often implied purely from context. 

So in the end, basic sentence structure is like this: 
(topic) wa ... (other information) .. (verb)
The last thing before desu should be either [[Nouns and pronouns|noun]] or adjective.
