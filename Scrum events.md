The sprint is a container for all other events. Every event in scrum serves 
the purpose of verifying the scrum artifacts. These events facilitate
transparency. If an event does not happen, an opportunity is missed where
adaptations can be made. The goal is also to minimize any other meetings that
are not defined by scrum. 

## Sprint 
Sprints are the main part of scrum. 
- No changes are made that could divert from the sprint goal.
- Meanwhile no quality should be lost. 
- Product backlog can be changes if new things are learned during the sprint. 

Sprints allow for predictability, because they are evaluated at least each
month. 
Smaller sprints around 2 weeks should be used to have a smaller feedback loop
and thus reduce risk. 

There are good tools to predict the progress, like the [[Burn-Down-Charts]], [[Burn
Up-Charts]] or [[Cumulative-Flow-Diagramme]], but they don't replace empiricism. 

The product owner is the one who can cancel the sprint of the sprint goal
becomes obsolete.

### Sprint planning
- Starts the sprint and defines what will be done in the sprint.
- The product owner takes the most important backlog items and explains them. 
There are 3 main topics in a spring: 
1. Why is this sprint valuable?
2. What can be defines as "done" in the sprint?
3. How will the defines work be done?
- Only developers define how they will do their work, no one else. They split up
  the work into packets that can be done in one day approximately.  

## Daily scrum
Asses the progress and make adaptations to the sprint backlog if needed.
A 15 minute event. Daily scrum improves communication, finds blockers, and
eliminate the need for other meetings.
