Decibels are used to measure many things. Most notably sound. 
The thing is, our ears can pick up pressure up to one millionth of a pascal to 20 million pascals. That is a huge number range, and the benefit of decibels is that they reduce this down to a small number range. It always needs a Pref aka a reference value for the domain.

In the domain of acoustics, the reference is 20microPascal as this is the treshhold of hearing. So when we say for example 60dB, it means the power is 20mP x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 aka one million times of the reference value. 

Important: doubling of power means increase in 3dB or cutting power in half means -3dB. 
The power times 10 is 10dB. 
A ration of 100:1 is 20dB and so on. If we know the ratios we dont need to use the formula as much. The pattern is that the first digit in the dB tells us just how many zeros we have in the ratio.
