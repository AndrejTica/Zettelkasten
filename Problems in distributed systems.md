Developers often assume these things to be true:
1. The network is reliable.
 2. The network is secure.
 3. The network is homogeneous.
 4. The topology does not change.
 5. Latency is zero.
 6. Bandwidth is infinite.
 7. Transport cost is zero.
 8. There is one administrator

This obviously is a factor when we are dealing with distributed systems as the components are spread across a network. Many issues are unique to distributed systems like reliability, security, heterogeneity, and topology of the network; latency and bandwidth; transport costs; and finally administrative domains.
