Three main types of redundancy:

#### Information redundancy
Extra bits are added to to allow for error detection or correction. Examples are check digits or hamming codes. 

#### Time redundancy
An action is performed multiple times in case the first one fails. Helpful with transient faults.

#### Physical redundancy
Extra hardware or processes are added so that a system as a whole can tolerate loss or malfunction of some components.
In biology we also have physical redundancy (two eyes, two kidneys etc..). A plane has more engines than it needs to fly.
