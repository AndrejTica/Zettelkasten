A certificate is just a public key, that is wrapped in some metadata. 
These are for example:
- **Identity Details** → Subject, Issuer, Serial Number
- **Validity Period** → Expiration Date
- **Public Key Data** → Key Algorithm, Key Size
- **Security Details** → Digital Signature, Revocation Info (OCSP/CRL)
- **Extensions** → Subject Alternative Name (SAN), Key Usage, CA policies
