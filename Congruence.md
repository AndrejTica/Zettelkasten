1. Congruence means when two numbers a and b are divided by n and leave the same remainder. Its written like so:
$$
a \equiv b \space (mod \space n)
$$
2. We can also write this as so where k is some number:
$$
a = kn + b
$$
3. When we subtract b on both sides we get an equation that means a-b is a multiple of n. The following means n "divides" a-b:
$$
n | (a-b)
$$
n is called "Modul" and a the "Rest modulo m"
