estimations are always based on guess work. I cant improve on it really, 
since estimates are not really based on past work. Past work does not impact what im doing now. 
Building a business on gambling. 
In the end, hitting the estimation does not provide any value. 
The value comes if we build the right thing. 
We could hit estimation estimate but what we built is completely useless in the end and doesnt generate value. 
The idea behind it is straightforward - you don't estimate anything in your Product Backlog; 
you only ask one question: does it fit a Sprint? When you get a no for an answer, you break the item into a smaller one. 
Only items that fit a Sprint can be part of your Sprint Planning.

- NoEstimates Disadvantages
The team misses the chance for gaining different perspectives.
It's hard to plan a Sprint when all you have is "yes, it fits" or "no, it doesn't fit."
After the estimation, the problem may still be unclear to team members.
- NoEstimates Advantages
The team saves at least two hours per Sprint by not doing estimates.
Developers don't get stressed by providing estimates they don't care about.
