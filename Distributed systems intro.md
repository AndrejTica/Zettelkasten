### Definition 
Various definitions exist for what distributed systems are. A loose characterization:
```
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system
```

We build distributed systems to achieve to make resources easily [[Resource accessibility|accessible]], to reasonably hide the fact that resources are distributed across a network, to be scalable and to be open. [1, p. 18]
