Mersenne numbers are numbers in form:
$$
2^n-1
$$
Some Mersenne numbers are prime, some not.

Is it true that the result of this is a prime if and only if n is prime?

- If n is not prime, then the result is not prime
- But if n is prime, then the result must be prime? NO, but the reverse is true, if the result is prime, then n is prime.

## Why are these numbers of interest?
1. [[Perfect numbers]]
2. Last 17 primes discovered were all Mersenne primes
