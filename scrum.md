Scrum is a light-weight framework to help organisations deliver value through
adaptive solutions. 
In short, scrum should push an environment where a scrum master helps with the
following:

- A product owner defines work and puts it into the backlog. 
- Helps the team to create an increment from this backlog.
- Helps the team validate the result of the increment and feed the feedback
back into the next increment. 
- repeat. 

Scrum only defines the minimum rule sets so that the goal can be achieved.
It purposely leaves out many details vague, since it does not want to give out
dogmas. It wants to emphasize people and interactions over detailed processes. 

Scrum is based on empiricism and lean thinking. Lean thinking reduces waste and
focuses on what really matters. 

Scrum is based on an iterative approach to optimize predictability and risk.
It puts people of all types of skill required to complete some work. 

Its based on 3 empirical pillars:

1. Transparency
The work needs to be transparent to everyone, as decisions are made based on
this. Artifacts that are not transparent, are wasteful. 

2. Examination
The work needs to be examined after it has become transparent. Are we moving in
the right direction? This allows for adaptation. As soon as we learn something
new, we need to adapt. Everyone from the teams should be empowered to do so.
